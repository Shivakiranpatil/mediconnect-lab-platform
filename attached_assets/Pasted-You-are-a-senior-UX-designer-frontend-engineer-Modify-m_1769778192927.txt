You are a senior UX designer + frontend engineer.

Modify my EXISTING homepage (do not rebuild from scratch) to make it a clear LAB AGGREGATOR website and to add three new homepage sections:
1) “How It Works” (reduce anxiety early),
2) “Why Book Through Us” (value props),
3) “Test Finder (AI)” (symptom-to-test suggestions).

Goal:
Increase clarity, trust, and conversions for patients, normal users, and elderly users on desktop.

GLOBAL RULES:
- This is a LAB AGGREGATOR: users compare labs, prices, and book tests or home collection.
- Avoid AI diagnosis. The AI feature is only for “test suggestions to consider”.
- Keep language simple, reassuring, and non-technical.
- Preserve the existing layout/components where possible; modify content, hierarchy, and add sections.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) Update HERO (Aggregator Positioning)
------------------------------------------------------------
Replace existing hero copy with:

Headline:
“Book Blood Tests from Trusted Labs Near You”

Subheadline:
“Compare prices, choose certified diagnostic labs, and book home sample collection in minutes.”

Hero controls:
- City selector dropdown (required)
- Test search bar with placeholder: “Search tests (CBC, Thyroid, Sugar, Vitamin D…)”
- Add “Popular tests” quick chips under search.

Primary CTA:
“Search Tests”

Secondary CTA:
“Browse Packages” or “View Popular Tests”

Add a small trust microcopy line under CTAs:
“Certified labs • Transparent pricing • Support available”

------------------------------------------------------------
B) Add Section: HOW IT WORKS (Reduce Anxiety Early)
------------------------------------------------------------
Add this section directly below the hero (or after any existing banner):

Title:
“How Booking a Test Works”

4 steps (simple, reassuring):
1) “Choose your test”
   “Search by test name or browse by category.”
2) “Compare labs & prices”
   “See trusted labs near you with clear pricing.”
3) “Book home collection or visit lab”
   “Pick a slot that works for you.”
4) “Get tested”
   “The lab confirms your appointment and completes the test.”

Add a small reassurance line below:
“We connect you to certified partner labs. Testing is done by the lab.”

------------------------------------------------------------
C) Add Section: WHY BOOK THROUGH US
------------------------------------------------------------
Add a section below “How It Works”.

Title:
“Why Book Through Us”

Bullet/value cards (4–6 max):
- “Compare prices across multiple labs”
- “Certified and verified partner labs”
- “Transparent pricing (no hidden charges)”
- “Home collection available”
- “Support team to help you book”
- “Easy rebooking & assistance (if offered)”

CTA button:
“Compare Labs” (anchors to test search/results)

------------------------------------------------------------
D) Add Section: TEST FINDER (AI) — Symptom → Test Suggestions
------------------------------------------------------------
Add a section below “Why Book Through Us” or as a tab next to the main test search.
Label it clearly as optional help for unsure users.

Section title:
“Not Sure Which Test to Book? Try Test Finder (AI)”

UI requirements (elderly-friendly):
- Symptom chips: Fever, Cold, Cough, Sore throat, Headache, Fatigue, Stomach pain, Diarrhea, Body aches, UTI symptoms
- Searchable dropdown for additional symptoms
- Optional fields:
  - Age group (Under 12, 13–17, 18–40, 41–60, 60+)
  - Duration (1–2 days, 3–7 days, 1–2 weeks, 2+ weeks)
- “Urgent symptoms?” checklist (red flags):
  - Chest pain
  - Severe shortness of breath
  - Confusion/fainting
  - Severe dehydration
  - Uncontrolled bleeding
CTA:
“Get test suggestions”

Output requirements:
- Must display results grouped:
  1) “Suggested tests to consider”
  2) “Common add-ons” (optional)
  3) “Relevant packages” (optional)
- Each test item shows:
  - Test name
  - One-line reason in simple language
  - Button: “Compare labs”
- Provide a combined CTA:
  “Compare labs for all suggested tests”

Safety requirements:
- Must show disclaimer above results:
  “This tool provides general test suggestions for booking convenience. It is not a diagnosis.”
- If any red-flag symptom is selected:
  - Show urgent_warning message FIRST:
    “Your symptoms may need urgent medical evaluation. Please seek immediate medical help.”
  - Then optionally show booking guidance only AFTER warning.

Implementation requirements:
- Add an API route / backend endpoint (depending on stack) that sends user inputs to an LLM and expects STRICT JSON output.
- Use a strict JSON schema like:
{
  "disclaimer": "...",
  "urgent_warning": {"show": true/false, "message": "..."},
  "suggested_tests": [{"name":"", "reason":"", "priority":"high|med|low"}],
  "add_ons": [{"name":"", "reason":""}],
  "packages": [{"name":"", "reason":"", "cta":"View package"}]
}
- Render with loading state, error state, and safe JSON parsing.

Include the LLM prompt used, with these strict rules:
- No diagnosis
- No medication advice
- Cautious language (“may consider”, “often used to evaluate”)
- JSON only, no extra text

------------------------------------------------------------
E) UX/Accessibility Adjustments (Desktop + Elderly)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Increase base font size and button size where appropriate.
- Improve contrast and spacing.
- Ensure CTAs are obvious and consistent (primary vs secondary).
- Add visible “Need help booking?” support block with phone/WhatsApp if available.

Output:
- Provide updated homepage sections with final copy text.
- Provide code changes/components added.
- Provide the API route/service code and the LLM prompt for structured JSON.
